There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Sub-Heading ##
  > Become a pioneer of your subconcious mind.

## Summary ##
  > Delve into the depths of your subconcious mind by keeping track of your dreams and exploring what they mean. A user can submit a summary of a dream linked with specific tags related to strong motifs within the dream or actual events in their waking life. Users can also see how or if other people around the world are dreaming about similar topics. Users can comment and interact with each other to discuss/explore their dream states. This application is not limited to just dream discussion, but can also be used to discuss problems and issues in your waking life. 

## Problem ##
  > A lack of an efficient way to keep track of your dreams while also connecting with others to explore what they mean and how they might relate to your waking life. 
  > Keeping a log of your dreams greatly helps improve your ability to recall dreams after you wake up. This can help:
  > 1). Enhance ones creativity to solve problems in the real world
  >     In a dream state your brain is not bound by the same logical rules that it has during waking life. When you are dreaming you are able to create new connections and different associations i.e.  you are able to create new neural pathways in your brain.
  > 2). Increase Self-Awareness
  >    Improving dream recall can greatly help provide insight into your emotional, physical, and metal health.
  > 3). Become more aware within your dreams (LUCID DREAMING)
  >     Improving dream recall can help you focus on becoming more lucid within your dream state, allowing you to stay asleep but be more concious of what is going on around you within you dreamscape. 
  > 4). Explore/Adventure
  >     You dreams are only bound by your imagination.
